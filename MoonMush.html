      <h1>MOON MUSH</h1>
    <p>
        My dog likes the mush alright<br>
        swear I feed him every night<br>
        with his eyes he speaks his mind<br>
        says I won't be here when you die
    </p>

    <p>
        I can't be who you are<br>
        but I can set you free<br>
        from your brain, from your heart<br>
        from this bitter sorry start
    </p>

    <p>
        My mom thinks she reads my mind<br>
        makes the same joke every time<br>
        wipes the drop right down my eye<br>
        breaks my bones and treats me right
    </p>

    <p>
        I don't know who you are<br>
        but I know, I believe<br>
        in my brain, in my heart<br>
        that I've gotta play my part
    </p>

    <p>
        Son you'll love the starts in time<br>
        Life's a bath in moon and sky<br>
        They'll think of you when you cry<br>
        Don't mind mom she's only tired
