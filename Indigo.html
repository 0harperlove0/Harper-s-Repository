      <h1>INDIGO</h1>

      <p>
        Nothing's gonna happen<br>
        in this big old shiny house<br>
        where the windows clog your breathing<br>
        and the floorboards shut their mouths
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been practicing believing<br>
        in a lamp I cannot see<br>
        in the dusty light I meet you<br>
        now the water crowds my feet
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm older now<br>
        the memory's getting tired<br>
        but you're still around<br>
        I'm out of sound <br>
        histories to rely on<br>
        the engine's down
      </p>

      <p>
        No one's gonna save you<br>
        from the child underneath<br>
        is that what you meant to tell me<br>
        is that why you had to leave
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been trying to forgive you<br>
        I've been singing you to sleep<br>
        I've been smoking just to feed you<br>
        but the fire burns my teeth
      </p>

      <p>
        My mother's proud<br>
        to have another daughter<br>
        to dream about<br>
        Another hour<br>
        another chance expired<br>
        remember how
      </p>

      <p>
        The blood was drawn<br>
        on our old front lawn<br>
        it took me by surprise<br>
        I'll close your eyes<br>
        sweet indigo child
