      <p>
        Reach your hand in a bucket full<br>
        of sloppy promises of rot<br>
        was it you or was it someone<br>
        I couldn't have remembered having lost
      </p>

      <p>
        He brushed my shoulder<br>
        she kissed my kneck<br>
        All these people<br>
        scattered in water <br>
        looking at the landlife like innocent fish
      </p>

      <p>
        Squeeze the juice out the cosmic fruit<br>
        growing out the edges of your garden<br>
        you didn't mean to plant it<br>
        you didn't know you had it<br>
        but someone was looking out for you
      </p>

     <p>
        Why go home early<br>
        why waste til death<br>
        All these people<br>
        loving isn't evil<br>
        mossy looking people <br>
        dancing in the cracks<br>
        of the wall
      </p>
