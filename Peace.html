      <h1>PEACE</h1>

      <p>
        How do I find peace<br>
        could the haunting be<br>
        a message from a fallen tree<br>
        it's how they talk to me
      </p>

      <p>
        Through an opening<br>
        there's a hole in me<br>
        and it swarms with fireflies<br>
        bringing dust to life<br>
        I'm heavy with the other side
      </p>

      <p>
        Does a vessel ever think to leave<br>
        the body that she knows<br>
        could she make a home<br>
        from energy, hope, and painted stones<br>
        could she live alone
      </p>
