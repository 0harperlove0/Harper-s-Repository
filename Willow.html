      <h1>WILLOW</h1>
    <p>
        Where did it go<br>
        the pattern in the snow<br>
        the forgotten eye glass<br>
        that we gave to a dragon<br>
        on our way back to our mountain homw
    </p>

    <p>
        Where did we go<br>
        there's a light behind the styrofoam<br>
        the remaining pieces<br>
        of a game underwater<br>
        that we played until the river froze
    </p>

    <p>
        Never leave the shadow of your willow tree<br>
        protecting your ephemeral infinity<br>
        The living room was hard on you<br>
        growing old
    </p>

    <p>
        Where did she go<br>
        baby hide behind the palendrome<br>
        all the circular phrases<br>
        that we made out of plywood<br>
        and the day revised the starry home
    </p>

    <p>
        Never leave the shadow of your willow tree<br>
        protecting your ephemeral infinity<br>
        You learned to run<br>
        you lied because<br>
        eyes don't know
    </p>

    <p>
        Where did she go
