      <h1>HEAVEN</h1>

      <p>
        Trying hard <br>
        tired of trying so hard<br>
        tired of writing letters to your lovers<br>
        in a secret dying lullaby
      </p>

      <p>
        Driving far<br>
        never driving too far<br>
        always looking farther than you're going<br>
        would you settle for the highest sky
      </p>

      <p>
        Is this heaven<br>
        the motionless untold<br>
        there's gotta be another home<br>
        for us, for me
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing songs<br>
        only writing some songs<br>
        only writing songs when you can hear them<br>
        can you bear to hear them twice
      </p>

      <p>
        She's my all<br>
        plastered on my mind walls<br>
        funny how the mind falls in a circle<br>
        are we thinking of the same old dream
      </p>

      <p>
        It's my heaven<br>
        my only place<br>
        and it's made of falling sand caves<br>
        would you hold me when the curtains break
      </p>
