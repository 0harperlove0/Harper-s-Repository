      <h1>GREEN BLUE</h1>
    <p>
        Love is blue it falls on the ground floor <br>
        every dew remembers the sky when it tore<br>
        Could the rain smell live in a memory<br>
        does the house hold everything buckets can save
    </p>

    <p>
        The dust rose<br>
        and the earth closed<br>
        but the dark road to the soft world<br>
        made your heart ache
    </p>

    <p>
        Did your lips bend into the difference<br>
        was the difference a pleasure to know<br>
        We are floating out of the membrane<br>
        we are leaving cracks in the floor
    </p>

    <p>
        The wood burns<br>
        to the mouth turns<br>
        to blood pulse you make for<br>
        loving impulse
    </p>

    <p>
        I am waiting under an oak tree<br>
        I am sleeping under a grass bed<br>
        Leaves are falling into the old home<br>
        Green is fickle nobody feeds it<br>
        Green is fickle nobody feeds it<br>
        Green is fickle<br>
        Green is fickle
    </p>
